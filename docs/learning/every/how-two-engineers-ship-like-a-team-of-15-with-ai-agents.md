If you’re using AI to just write code, you’re missing out.
Two engineers at Every shipped six features, five bug fixes, and three infrastructure
updates in one week—and they did it by designing workflows with AI agents, where each
task makes the next one easier, faster, and more reliable.
In this episode of AI & I, Dan Shipper interviewed the pair—Kieran Klaassen, general
manager of Cora, our inbox management tool, and Cora engineer Nityesh Agarwal—
about how they’re compounding their engineering with AI. They walk Dan through their
workflow in Anthropic’s agentic coding tool, Claude Code, and the mental models they’ve
developed for making AI agents truly useful. Kieran, our resident AI-agent aficionado,
also ranked all the AI coding assistants he’s used. You can check out their full conversation

🎧 How Two Engineers Ship Like a Team of 15 With AI Agents

If you want a quick summary, here are some of the themes they touch on:

The workflow you can use to 10x your engineering
capabilities
At the heart of Kieran and Nityesh’s workflow with AI is a meta move: They built a prompt
that writes prompts. With help from Anthropic’s Prompt Improver, they created a custom
command in Claude Code that transforms a rough feature idea into a fleshed-out GitHub
issue. Each issue includes a clear explanation of the problem, a proposed solution, the
technical details needed to make it happen, and a step-by-step implementation plan. The
agent pulls in relevant parts of the existing code and best practices from the web to help
guide the approach.
Once the GitHub issue is created, they review it themselves and queue it up to be
implemented. By planning the work, writing out the issue, and then reviewing it, they
create space to think clearly about the problem before any code is written. Unlike AI code
editor Cursor, which is “made to code,” Kieran says Claude Code reduces the friction to
think things through before jumping into execution.
Even better, Kieran and Nityesh say they rarely bother with typing. They speak to their
computers using an internal voice-to-text tool called Monologue, which is currently being
incubated here at Every.

How to write reliable code with AI agents
For Nityesh, an important mental model for coding with AI comes from a decades-old
management book, High Output Management by Andy Grove, Intel’s former CEO. The
principle is simple: In any production process, fix problems while the stakes are still low. In
the context of Claude Code, that means putting extra care into the earliest parts of the
workflow, before the agent actually starts coding.
It’s tempting to immediately ask Claude to implement a GitHub issue it just wrote, but
that can backfire. Nityesh says, “There are chances that [Claude’s] plan… wasn't the
direction that you wanted to go, and you want to catch that before you ask Claude to go
and implement the solution.”

Dan admits he tends to rush through the planning phase because reading a wall of text
generated by an LLM can be boring. The trick, Kieran says, is to shape the plan so it's both
informative and engaging. One way to do this is prompting Claude to ask them questions
like a good product manager would. Dan notes a similar approach in a new, yet-unreleased
version of Spiral, Every’s content generation tool. General manager Danny Aziz is
building a writing agent that interviews you to help you articulate your thoughts better.

Kieran rates coding agents
Kieran has a reputation at Every for testing every coding agent that hits the market, and
Dan got him to rank them. Kieran's clear top choice is Claude Code because it goes beyond
just coding to handle research, workflows, and everything else. Amp comes in second;
Kieran praises its “ergonomics” and notes that it feels like a tool built by people who
actually use it. Friday rounds out his top tier because of its opinionated workflows that just
work. Even though it doesn’t use Claude 4 yet, he's seen it pull off things he couldn't
replicate in Claude Code.
And on the other end of the scale: Windsurf represents the brutal pace of this space—just
weeks ago it would've been high up on the list, but without Claude 4, it's quickly fallen
behind. GitHub Copilot sits at the bottom of Kieran’s list, though he admits this might be
unfair since he hasn’t tested its newer agentic capabilities.
