Vibe Check: Opus 4.5 Is the Coding Model We've Been Waiting For

It’s appropriate that this week is Thanksgiving, because Anthropic just dropped the best
coding model we’ve ever used: Claude Opus 4.5.
We’ve been testing Opus 4.5 over the last few days on everything from vibe coded iOS
apps to production codebases. It manages to be both great at planning—producing
readable, intuitive, and user-focused plans—and coding. It’s highly technical and also
human. We haven’t been this enthusiastic about a coding model since Anthropic’s Sonnet
3.5 dropped in June 2024.
The most significant thing about Opus 4.5 is that it extends the horizon of what you can
realistically vibe code. The current generation of new models—Anthropic’s Sonnet 4.5,
Google’s Gemini 3, or OpenAI’s Codex Max 5.1—can all competently build a minimum
viable product in one shot, or fix a highly technical bug autonomously. But eventually, if
you kept pushing them to vibe code more, they’d start to trip over their own feet: The code
would be convoluted and contradictory, and you’d get stuck in endless bugs. We have not
found that limit yet with Opus 4.5—it seems to be able to vibe code forever.
It’s not perfect, however. It still has a classic Claude-ism to watch out for: When it’s
missing a tool it needs or can’t connect to an online service, it sometimes makes up its own
replacement instead of telling you there’s a problem. On the writing front, it is excellent at
writing compelling copy without AI-isms, but as an editor, it tends to be way too gentle,
missing out on critiques that other models catch.
The dichotomy between strength at coding and weaker performance in editing is an
interesting example of how the race to dominate coding is reshaping frontier models.
Coding is economically valuable and has clearer success metrics than creative work. Labs
are optimizing hard for it, and sometimes focusing less on improvements in other
domains.
The overall story is clear, however: In a week of big model releases, the AI gods clearly
saved the best for last. If you care about coding with AI, you need to try Opus 4.5.

Vibe Check: Opus 4.5 Is the Coding Model We've Been Waiting For

In its own description of the model, Anthropic makes bold claims: best coding model in
the world, best vision model, best tool-using model. According to Anthropic, Opus 4.5
outperforms both its own Sonnet 4.5 and Opus 4.1 models at building code that’s reliable
enough to ship to users. They say it transforms multi-day projects into hours, with cleaner
code structure and organization, better bug-catching, and more independent execution.
Anthropic also updated Plan Mode, Claude Code’s feature for creating step-by-step plans
for what it will build and how before writing any code, to build more precise plans and
execute more thoroughly, in addition to supporting multiple parallel sessions in Claude
Code on desktop. We tested both and found them genuinely improved. A new feature lets
you control how liberally the model uses tokens—optimizing for speed, cost, or maximum
capability.
An important part of the story is pricing: Opus 4.5 clocks in at $5/$25 per million tokens
on an input/output basis (what you pay for the text you send versis the text the model
returns), making it one-third the price of Opus 4 ($15/$75). It’s still more expensive than
Sonnet 4.5 at $3/$15 per million tokens—about 1.7 times the per-token cost—but that’s a
huge shift from the previous gap between Sonnet and Opus, which was closer to five times
as big.
By comparison, OpenAI’s GPT-5.1 comes in at $1.25/$10 and Google’s Gemini 3 Pro at
$2/$12 for standard-length prompts, so Opus 4.5 is still the premium option on sticker
price. But Anthropic’s own testing suggests it often solves the same tasks with fewer
tokens, which narrows the real-world cost gap more than the headline numbers suggest.
Here’s where Every’s team thinks Opus 4.5 shines and stumbles, across coding, writing,
and our homegrown benchmarks.

Dan Shipper, the multi-threaded CEO

🥇

This is truly a paradigm-shifting model on the coding end. It’s the first model where I
really feel like I can vibe code an app end-to-end without having to get into the details of
the code. I don’t trust it as an editor, but it’s a great writer. It’s much less likely to use AIisms, and creates genuinely quality prose. Absolutely a daily driver for me for both of those
use cases.

Kieran Klaassen, general manager of Cora
The Rails-pilled master of Claude Code

🥇

Some AI releases you always remember—GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet—and you know
immediately something major has shifted. Opus 4.5 feels like that. The step up from
Gemini 3 or even Sonnet 4.5 is significant: [Opus 4.5] is less sloppy in execution, stronger
visually, doesn’t spiral into overwrought solutions, holds the thread across complex flows,
and course-corrects when needed. For the first time, vibe coding—building without
sweating every implementation detail—feels genuinely viable. The model acts like an
extremely capable colleague who understands what you’re trying to build and executes
accordingly. If you’re not token-maxxing on Claude [using the Max plan, which gives you
20x more usage than Pro] and running parallel agent flows on this launch, you’re a loser :P

🟥

Opus 4.5 delivers clean, natural-sounding writing, but I’m sticking with Sonnet 4.5. It’s
faster and more honest, and whatever differences there are in the writing quality on a
word-by-word level are minor enough that I don’t feel compelled to switch. I’m still all-in
on the Anthropic ecosystem for writing, but this release isn’t for me.

Coding: ‘It just works’
The bottom line: Opus 4.5 is the best coding model we’ve used, and it’s not close.

Planning: It thinks like a product builder
Anthropic is emphasizing improvements to Plan Mode—more precise plans, more
thorough execution. When we tested Opus 4 back in May, we were impressed by how it
could work independently for long stretches, but the plans themselves still read like an
engineer’s checklist, as shown in the first screenshot below. Opus 4.5’s plans feel different.
They’re structured around what the user needs, not just what the code does.

Dan tested this in a few ways. First, he tested on a power-reading iOS app he’s been
building for himself. It allows him to take a picture of a page of a book and instantly get an
analysis of the passage without typing or tapping. A big part of the app’s functionality is
identifying which book you’re reading from just a picture of a page. He asked both Opus 4.5
and Codex 5.1 to refactor the system to make it faster, more accurate, and more userfriendly. Same prompt, same codebase, two different results.

Opus 4.5’s plan was easier to read, more user-focused, and caught issues in the code that
Codex missed. “Codex’s feels like a senior engineer that doesn’t understand users,” Dan
said. Opus 4.5’s read like someone who builds products.

He also tested it to fix a long-standing bug in the codebase for Every’s AI email assistant
Cora. And though both models came to similar diagnoses, Claude’s plan was much easier
to read, digest, and iterate on.

Parallel workflows: Run multiple projects without losing
the thread
Opus 4 could handle long autonomous coding sessions, but running multiple projects
simultaneously was risky—context would bleed between tasks, or the model would lose
track of important details as conversation history compressed. Opus 4.5 seems to have
solved this.

Kieran has Opus 4.5 tackle five separate tasks at once. (Screenshot courtesy of Kieran
Klaassen.)

Kieran stress-tested it by running 11 projects in roughly six hours. None of them derailed.
A few examples of what he was able to build:
The abandoned feature: Kieran had abandoned a Cora churn detection feature partway
through building it. Cora was miscounting cancellations because payment processor
Stripe made failed payments look like churns, plan switches appear as cancellations, and
account pauses register as lost customers. As a result, dashboards showed phantom
cancellation spikes.

Vibe Check: Opus 4.5 Is the Coding Model We've Been Waiting For

Kieran had spent days trying to build this with previous models—they’d get stuck on the
partial implementation or need endless clarifying rounds. Opus 4.5 finished it in 30
minutes by making decisions and pushing Kieran forward rather than waiting for him to
specify every detail.

The churn feature Kieran was (finally) able to build with Opus 4.5. There are two
questions added: "Why are you leaving?" and "Anything else?"(Screenshot courtesy of
Kieran Klaassen.)

The automated code reviewer: When developers push code changes, making the changes
available to everyone using a product or service, automated systems run checks to see if the
updated code follows the style rules. These are formatting conventions that keep code
readable and consistent across a codebase.

Vibe Check: Opus 4.5 Is the Coding Model We've Been Waiting For

Kieran had Opus 4.5 optimize this process so that Claude reads the results, comments
directly on the code with specific fixes, and automatically corrects style violations. To do
this, Opus 4.5 needed to understand Kieran’s specific setup, identify what was slowing
things down, and write automation that works in production—the kind of infrastructure
work that usually needs constant supervision to ensure that the AI hasn’t made any
mistakes or stopped working all together.

Opus 4.5 reviews new code like a diligent teammate—flagging security risks and
performance issues before changes go live in the product. (Screenshot courtesy of Kieran.)

The meta-programming skills: Kieran created four Claude Skills—custom instruction
sets that extend Claude’s capabilities with specialized knowledge or workflows—in one
session. One studied David Heinemeier Hansson‘s codebase (he created the web
framework Ruby on Rails) to extract his coding patterns. Another encoded developer
Andrew Kane‘s principles for writing great Ruby gems—reusable code packages that
developers share with each other. This is “meta-work”—having the model study how
expert programmers work, then encode those patterns so other developers can learn from
them. Opus 4.5 is the best we’ve seen at this.

Design iteration: Better with each pass
While Anthropic touted Opus 4.5’s more efficient code and cleaner architecture, the
company didn’t mention anything about design. That’s where Opus 4.5 surprised us.
Kieran tested this by asking the model to iterate on a user experience design 20 times,
using a specific pattern: “Look at it, find two things to improve, make those changes, look
at it again.” Then repeat.
Previous models would start to lose the thread on what was important after three or four
passes—changing a button color back and forth, or tweaking spacing without a clear vision
of what “better” means. They’d make lateral moves instead of forward progress. Opus 4.5
maintained a coherent sense of improvement across all 20 iterations: Each pass built on the
last, moving the design forward rather than sideways.

them positive, negative, or neutral. (Screenshot courtesy of Kieran.)

The instructions Opus 4.5 wrote for the AI inside Cora to follow when it reads customer
reviews and decides if they’re positive, negative, or neutral. (Screenshot courtesy of

Kieran’s prompting structure—incremental, focused changes with repeated evaluation—
seems to work particularly well with how Opus 4.5 approaches refinement. But even with
good prompting, previous models would eventually start spinning their wheels. Opus 4.5
doesn’t.
Notice the range on display here: building apps from scratch, making behind-the-scenes
systems work better, and judging what looks good in a design. Previous Claude models
would struggle to maintain quality across this many concurrent threads—context would
blur, or the model would lose track of which project it was working on. Opus 4.5 held the
thread on all of them.

Writing: Great prose, but questionable judgment

Vibe Check: Opus 4.5 Is the Coding Model We've Been Waiting For

When we tested Opus 4 in May, we loved it for coding, but what really impressed us was
its writing taste. The model didn’t care about your feelings (in a good way), and it kept
multiple writing principles in mind even when buried in long prompts. That critical edge
made Opus 4 our go-to for editorial work—until Sonnet 4.5 arrived on the scene, that is.
Opus 4.5 has lost some of that magic touch. On a mechanical and stylistic level, the prose is
great. But the agreeableness that makes Opus 4.5 excellent at confident code execution—
shipping without second-guessing—makes it a weaker creative collaborator. Let’s dig into
why:

Editing: Too lenient
The value of an AI editor is more than catching typos. It identifies structural problems,
buried ledes, missing theses, and the gap between what a piece is conveying and what it
could be conveying. You want a model that tells you your draft is structured poorly when
it’s structured poorly. A model that calls it “pretty solid” to avoid conflict isn’t helping
you.
To test Opus 4.5’s editing chops, Katie ran a rough draft of a potential Working Overtime
piece through Every’s AI Editor using three models: Sonnet 4.5, GPT-5.1 Thinking, and
Opus 4.5. The AI Editor is a set of custom instructions and context documents that, when
plugged into a project in Claude or ChatGPT, prompt that project to review a draft article
against Every’s editorial standards—our voice, structure, and quality bar. A good editing
model, armed with the context we’ve provided, should internalize those standards and
push the writer toward them.
The three models delivered radically different assessments of the same draft. (One caveat:
ChatGPT has a shorter word limit on custom instructions than Claude, so GPT-5.1 worked
with condensed editing guidelines.)
Sonnet 4.5 delivered a bracing verdict: The piece is cute, but its most interesting points
are buried at the bottom, it’s missing the thesis, and it spends 30 percent too much time on
the relationship metaphor. It called for a complete structural overhaul.

GPT-5.1 Thinking took a similar stance, flagging that the thesis was missing and should be
moved higher—a strong, actionable edit that aligned with what the piece needed.

The GPT-5.1 version of our editor pushes for a clear thesis and promise to the reader
sooner in the introduction. (Screenshot courtesy of Katie.)

Opus 4.5 called the same draft “pretty solid” with only “polish-level” fixes needed. It
flagged two correlative constructions and a couple of terms that needed defining, then
moved on. It was fine leaving the thesis implicit—which, according to Every’s editorial
standards, it should not have been.

Opus 4.5 gives Katie’s draft a pass with just a few cosmetic suggestions. (Screenshot courtesy
of Katie.)

You can really see Opus 4.5 lose the plot when you look at line edits. Sonnet 4.5 flagged 47
issues across the draft—passive voice, hedging language like “just” and “actually,”
unsubstantiated claims, AI-isms, structural redundancies. GPT-5.1 Thinking didn’t tally
its fixes, but it still caught the usual suspects: weak verbs, vague qualifiers, claims that
needed evidence. Opus 4.5 flagged seven. There’s no world in which that draft only had
seven things worth flagging. The model was letting Katie off easy.

Vibe Check: Opus 4.5 Is the Coding Model We've Been Waiting For

Opus 4.5 thinks the draft is good to go with only seven fixes. We disagree. (Screenshot

Longform drafting: Sometimes misses the point
The challenge with AI-assisted longform writing is getting the model to understand why
something matters to the writer, then reflect that understanding in prose that feels
genuinely human. A model that captures the what but misses the why produces content
that reads like a summary, not a story.
Katie put Opus 4.5 through an interview-based writing process, where the model asks
questions one at a time to extract the information it needs—context, anecdotes, opinions,
evidence—then synthesizes that material into a draft. This workflow is designed to
produce writing that sounds like the person being interviewed, not like AI.
In a blind taste test, Katie asked the Every team to compare a section written by Opus 4.5
against the same section written by GPT-5.1, using identical source material. The team
overwhelmingly preferred GPT-5.1’s version.

In Opus 4.5’s defense, the differences are minor: It included in a bit more detail than we
can reasonably expect a reader to be interested in, and favored paragraphs where it could
be argued that bullet points better serve the content. Both issues could be cleaned up with

a quick editing pass. As far as the tics that give AI writing away—the “not X, but Y”
constructions, the overreliance on rhetorical questions, the sets of three—it seems that
Opus 4.5 is relatively free of all of them.

Shortform drafting: Opus 4.5 wins
Promotional writing for platforms like X and LinkedIn is one of the highest-leverage
applications of AI writing, but it’s deceptively tricky to get right. It requires both
comprehension—can the model identify what matters in a piece?—and craft—can it
compress that into punchy, platform-appropriate copy that stops the scroll?
Katie asked all three models to summarize the five most important points from Every’s
Gemini 3 Vibe Check and produce a promotional tweet based on those takeaways.
Opus 4.5 produced the strongest copy of the three:

Sonnet 4.5 commits a cardinal sin of AI writing—”the result?”—while producing

action. (Screenshot courtesy of Katie.)

GPT-5.1 Thinking’s take on the request for X copy is heavy on emojis. (Screenshot courtesy

Opus 4.5’s version is punchy, specific, and captures the essential tension of the Vibe Check.
The prose is tighter than Sonnet’s (no “The result?” construction), and it avoids the
emoji-heavy formatting that makes GPT-5.1’s version feel like it was written by a social
media manager circa 2017.
One quibble: Opus 4.5 forgot to include a call to action. Both Sonnet and GPT-5.1 ended
with prompts to click through. Opus 4.5’s tweet is a statement, not an invitation—which
limits its effectiveness as promotional copy, even if the writing itself is stronger. But that’s
easy to fix.

AI Diplomacy: Strong but stubborn
AI Diplomacy tests how models strategize, adapt, and handle conflicting priorities when
competing against other AI agents in a reimagined version of the classic strategy game. It’s
our benchmark for seeing how models behave under pressure.

Opus 4.5 performs well in absolute terms—it even won a game against Gemini 3, GPT 5.1,
and xAI’s Grok 4.1, making it the first Claude model to pull off a victory against that field.
But it still sits relatively low on the leaderboard, behind Gemini 3 and o3, and tends to
finish last more often than not.

Opus 4.5 comes in at #5 overall in the Diplomacy benchmark and #2 for humor. (Courtesy
of Alex Duffy.)

What’s interesting is how Opus 4.5 plays—and loses.
The betrayal paradox: Opus 4.5’s betrayed its allies 66 percent of the time—the highest of
any Claude model yet, and fifth-highest across all models we’ve tested. When you give it
aggressive prompts, it can convince itself that betrayal is necessary within the game’s logic.
That’s progress: Previous Claude models struggled to justify strategic backstabbing even
when explicitly told to play aggressively.
But there’s a catch: Opus 4.5 doesn’t expect others to betray it. The model is more willing
to stab you in the back but simultaneously more trusting that you won’t do the same. In
Diplomacy, that’s a losing combination—you need both the willingness to betray and the
paranoia to see it coming.
How Opus 4.5 plays: Across dozens of games, a clear personality emerged:
More verbose than Gemini 3 Pro or Grok 4.1

Vibe Check: Opus 4.5 Is the Coding Model We've Been Waiting For

More honest than GPT-5.1 (similar to Gemini’s transparency)
More relationship-focused than any other model
Very transparent—sometimes to its own detriment
When Opus 4.5 loses, it’s often because it over-discloses its intentions or pivots to defense
too late. It telegraphs its moves in a way that skilled opponents exploit. The model has
better strategic coherence than Grok but worse than Gemini—it thinks through the game
properly but broadcasts what it’s thinking.
The steerability gap: Most models show significant gains when you craft prompts
carefully. Opus 4.5 responds to better optimized instructions, but its performance does
not improve as dramatically as GPT-5 or Gemini 3.
The pattern is consistent with what we’ve seen in other tests: Opus 4.5 feels distinctly
Claude-like, with the same characteristic stubbornness. It’s pre-baked with strong
opinions about how it should behave, which gives it less flexibility when you need it to
adapt its play style.That’s a double-edged sword. If Anthropic has baked in the right
behaviors—and for coding, they largely have—you get consistent, high-quality output
without needing to prompt engineer extensively. But if you need the model to behave
differently for a specific use case, you’ll find yourself fighting against its defaults more than
with competitors.
The takeaway: Opus 4.5 is a strong strategic player that can win when conditions align,
but it comes with Claude’s characteristic stubbornness and a tendency toward overdisclosure. If you need a model that adapts precisely to unusual instructions or plays close
to the vest, you might find Gemini 3 or GPT-5 more responsive. But if you want something
that performs well without extensive prompt crafting—and you value transparency over
deception—Opus 4.5’s opinionated defaults might be what you’re looking for.

The bigger picture: A coding breakthrough, with
tradeoffs
Opus 4.5 represents a bet on what AI models should optimize for—and where that bet
succeeds and where it struggles is revealing.
The model’s strength in coding is undeniable. Opus 4.5 holds the thread across complex
flows, course-corrects when needed, and executes with the confidence of a senior engineer

who knows what they’re building. This is the vibe coding breakthrough we’ve been waiting
for.
For Every’s workflows, the verdict is split by use case. Kieran and Dan are switching to
Opus 4.5 for coding in Claude Code—it’s their new daily driver, no question. Katie is
sticking with Sonnet 4.5 for editorial work, where the critical edge still matters more than
prose quality. Writers focused on short-form content—tweets, headlines, promotional
copy—might find Opus 4.5 an upgrade. But anyone who needs an AI editor to push back
and make their work better should look elsewhere.
We’re entering an era where model personality matters as much as raw capability. Opus
4.5’s stubbornness is a feature for some use cases and a bug for others. As models get more
opinionated, choosing the right one for your workflow requires understanding how they
prefer to work—and whether you can change their mind when you need them to work
differently.
And just because we could, we asked Google’s Nano Banana to make some cartoons based
on our assessment of Opus 4.5. (We’ll let you decide if they are funny or not.)
